"SecureAuth 360" is an advanced full-stack project engineered to prioritize user authentication and authorization, employing industry-standard security protocols such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt, and cookies. This robust application ensures that user data remains protected while delivering a seamless and intuitive authentication experience.

At its foundation, SecureAuth 360 is designed to address the critical aspects of user identity management, access control, and data security. The project offers a comprehensive suite of features aimed at safeguarding user accounts and sensitive information.

Key components and features of SecureAuth 360 include:

User Registration and Authentication: SecureAuth 360 allows users to create accounts securely using a multi-step registration process. Upon registration, users' passwords are hashed and stored using bcrypt, ensuring that sensitive information remains encrypted within the database.

JWT-Based Authentication: The application leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. Upon successful login, users receive a JWT that contains encoded information about their identity and access privileges. This token is securely transmitted between the client and server, allowing users to access protected resources without the need for continuous authentication.

Token-Based Session Management: To enhance security and mitigate the risk of session hijacking or CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks, SecureAuth 360 employs token-based session management. User authentication tokens are securely stored within HTTP-only cookies, mitigating the risk of client-side attacks and enhancing protection against unauthorized access.

SecureAuth 360 is built using a full-stack architecture, leveraging modern technologies such as Node.js for the back end, Express.js for routing, and MongoDB for data storage.

With its focus on robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, SecureAuth 360 represents a state-of-the-art solution for organizations and developers seeking to protect user identities and data in today's evolving threat landscape.
